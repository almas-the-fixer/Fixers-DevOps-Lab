**Version:** v1.0  

##  Project Description  
This Bash script displays essential server performance statistics ‚Äî including **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, **disk usage**, and the **top 5 processes** consuming the most CPU and memory.  

It helps quickly monitor a Linux system‚Äôs health and identify resource-heavy processes, making it a useful tool for basic server diagnostics or admin dashboards.
